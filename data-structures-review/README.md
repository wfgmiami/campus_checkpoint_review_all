# Review Week Checkpoint: Data Structures

## Fork the Repo

**Fork this repo** to your own Github account. Then `git clone` your forked repo to your local machine.

## Running the Specs

1. `npm install`
2. `npm test`
3. Navigate to the URL displayed by Test'Em

## Checkpoint Parameters

You may work on the suites in any order, except that to do `HashTable` you need a working `Alist`. Note that some suites are extra credit.

You can pass the `Queue` & `Stack` specs using simple array methods to begin. If you have time, attempt `Queue` & `Stack` solutions that use pointers (indices) or Linked Lists; however, you are encouraged to work on other specs first.

## Submitting your Code

You are encouraged to make commits at major milestones. Before the deadline, make sure to push up a submission commit:

1. `git commit -am 'submission for deadline'`
2. `git push`
