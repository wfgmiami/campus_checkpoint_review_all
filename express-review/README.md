# Review Week Checkpoint - Express

## Resources

Feel free to use any online documentation, but do **not** copy and paste any code. You may use any notes you've taken, but you may **not** refer to any past workshop or checkpoint code. Also do **not** work with others on this checkpoint (though feel free to do so after submitting).

## Starting

1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. Install node modules.
3. Read through the project as it currently stands.
4. Start working through the tests in `test.js` (run `npm test` to see how you're doing). You may have to mark them as active (from pending) by changing `xit` to `it`.

## Important

The first 15 specs are mandatory. Though you are encouraged to, you are not required to complete any of the specs after thatâ€”the final 13. The test source code includes a very noticeable comment at the border between mandatory and non-mandatory.

## Submitting

1. Add and commit to your repo
2. Push all changes to your fork
3. Mark checkpoint as complete in learn.fullstackacademy.com
